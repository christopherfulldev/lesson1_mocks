## First lesson off "Erick Wendel" course "Js Expert".

1 - The feature are based in JavaScript/NodeJS, and not has dependencies.

2- Clone this repository and run "node index.test.js". 

3- The absence of alerts means that the tests passed. Test including a change in any "Mocks" files to obtains an error message.

4- The "deepStrictlyEqual" "method" is provided for "assert" in node modules. It is used to compare what is received with what is expected([Object]X[Object]).

5 -The ".csv" files in this case are the basis for comparisons. There we specify all possible cases and later define those that will be treated as rejections by the aforementioned method.

6- "IIFE" are auto-invoked functions that can also work asynchronously.

7 - It is possible to create contexts using key pairs with statements inside. Because of this we can create variables with identical names, each in its own scope.

8- This feature was created using "OO" programming design.
